Telemigration

One day I found my Telegram account is full of channel subscriptions and the client's data file is taking too much space in my phone memory. But I don't want to unsubscribe now for some reason. I had an idea to create two separate Telegram accounts â€” one for conversation and another for subscriptions. I think it's a good idea if Telegram client had an option to save subscriptions in one account, and can restore it in another. But it doesn't.

This set of small scripts done this for me
